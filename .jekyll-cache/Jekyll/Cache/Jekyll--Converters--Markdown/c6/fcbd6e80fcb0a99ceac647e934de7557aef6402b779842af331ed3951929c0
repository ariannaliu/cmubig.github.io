I"z<p>Hi, nice to meet you! I’m Andrew. I completed my Master’s degree at Carnegie Mellon University’s Robotics Institute and am continuing for my PhD. I work on robust drone autonomy to aid in wildfires and disaster relief (see <a href="https://theairlab.org/wildfire">https://theairlab.org/wildfire</a>). I previously graduated from San Jose State University with a B.S. in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics.</p>

<p>On weekends, I enjoy playing basketball, volleyball, badminton, and tennis. I also love music, from being part of CMU’s <a href="https://www.cmucsharp.com/">C# vocal music organization</a> to friendly improv jams. I’m always on the lookout for my next adventure.</p>
