# Abstract

The fast-growing demand for fully autonomous aerial operations in shared spaces necessitates developing
trustworthy agents that can safely and seamlessly navigate in crowded, dynamic spaces. In this work, 
we propose **Social Robot Tree Search (SoRTS)**, an algorithm for the safe navigation of mobile robots in 
social domains. SoRTS aims to augment existing socially-aware trajectory prediction policies with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search planner for improved downstream navigation of mobile robots. To evaluate the 
performance of our method, we choose the use case of social navigation for general aviation. To aid 
this evaluation, within this work, we also introduce **X-PlaneROS**, a high-fidelity aerial simulator,
to enable more research in full-scale aerial autonomy. By conducting a user study based on the assessments 
of **26 FAA-certified pilots**, we show that SoRTS performs comparably to a competent human pilot, 
significantly outperforming our baseline algorithm. We further complement these results with
self-play experiments, showcasing our algorithmâ€™s behavior in scenarios with increasing complexity.

# Method

We present **Social Robot Tree Search (SoRTS)**, an algorithm for safe navigation of mobile robots in 
social settings. SoRTS aims to augment existing data-driven socially-aware motion prediction models 
with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner, enabling long-horizon social navigation. Altough the 
algorithm is domain-independent, in our work we use general aviation in non-towered airports as our 
case of study.

</p>


SoRTS' tree search is biased by **social** and a **reference** modules. The **social** module aims to 
handle *short-horizon agent-to-agent dynamics*. It does so by leveraging socially-aware motion 
prediction model which was trained offline on trajectory data.

</p>

The **reference** module provides a global path to the agent which embodies a navigation 
guideline *(e.g., an FAA-established flying pattern)* that the agent should stick to whenever there 
aren't any *social conflicts* to resolve. This module also provides a cost map that represents a
frequence count map to encourage the agent to visit most-frequent regions.

</p>

Finally, SoRTS's combines the decision modalities of these two modules via **Monte Carlo Tree Search 
(MCTS)** to achieve long-horizon navigation by backpropagating most sucessful outcomes.
