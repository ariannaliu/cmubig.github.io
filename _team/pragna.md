Hi all!

Iâ€™m a Robotics Ph.D. student working with Professor Jean Oh and Professor Nancy
Pollard on soft robot manipulation. My research focuses on designing
anthropomorphic soft robot hands for dexterous manipulation.

Outside of work, I enjoy poetry and trying new restaurants around Pittsburgh.
