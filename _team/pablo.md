Hello! My name is Pablo Ortega-Kral, and I am majoring in Robotics and Digital
Systems Engineering at Tec de Monterrey. My main experience in robotics is in
visual servoing for autonomous navigation. This summer I will be working with
Dr. Jean Oh and Ingrid Navarro at the roBot Intelligence Group (BIG) exploring
ways to do robust context-aware intent prediction for failure detection in
motion prediction.
