Hi there, this is Adi.

I'm a graduate student at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu "Robotics Institute Homepage"), Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing a Master's in Robotics (MSR). I graduated from SRM University in 2020, where I worked with Prof. S. Prabhu on collaborative manipulation for warehouse robots.

My research interest lies in the intersection between multi-agent systems, planning, and machine learning. I would like to develop cooperative systems that make 2 + 2 = 5.

If you would like to have a chat on any of these topics, or just play soccer, feel free to reach out!
