I currently study social robot navigation, where I research ways of improving perception, 
planning, and evaluation methodologies for robots which navigate among humans. Previously, 
I have worked in operating systems and reinforcement learning research, at University of 
Michigan as well as Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.
