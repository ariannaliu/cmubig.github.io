My name is Soonmin Hwang. I am a postdoctoral visitor at the Robotics Institute
with Prof. Jean Oh. Before joining Carnegie Mellon University, I worked for Tesla
(Palo Alto, CA, USA) as a Senior Machine Learning Scientist.

I received my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from KAIST
(Daejeon, South Korea) under the supervision of Prof. In So Kweon in 2014 and
2019, respectively. I was an intern at Qualcomm Research Austria (Vienna, Austria)
in 2016. I received my B.S. degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering from
Hanyang University (Seoul, South Korea) in 2012.

Iâ€™m diving deep into research on robust perception and data-centric AI for
autonomous driving, including computer vision, deep learning, and sensor fusion.
My vision is to realize fully autonomous driving, holding the potential to
significantly transform our everyday lives.
