Hello there, Iâ€™m Ziven, an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at
Northeastern University. My experiences range from remotely driven all-terrain
rovers, to mini-companion robots, and even autonomous aerial vehicles. This
summer I will be working with  Dr. Jean Oh and Uksang Yoo in the roBot
Intelligence Group (BIG) developing a method for acoustic sensing in soft robot
3D for proprioception. I have designed an apparatus to house several audio
components, and am in the process of training a model to predict the robot's position.

I'm constantly thrilled by the prospect of embracing new opportunities and
engaging in captivating experiences. If you want to chat about any of these
topics, feel free to reach out! I'm open to connecting and exploring new ideas.
