Hi! My name is Beverley.

I'm a 2nd year Masterâ€™s student advised by Dr.Jean Oh. I received my undergraduate
degree in Computer Science in 2021, and was a [RISS](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/)
intern in 2020. I like drawing, software, and psychology; so my research interests
include the Creative AI field and emotion studies.
